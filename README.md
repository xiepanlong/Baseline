This is the code for baseline. It consists of two parts: myCML and myCDL. It main implements some index of recommendation system, containing NDCG, AUC, precision and Recall@K.

* 1.CML: the index implemented in myCML.py, and the object is RecallEvaluator class, containing function cal_NDCG, cal_AUC, cal_precision, cal_Recall.

* 2.CDL: the index implemented in cal_NDCG.py, cal_auc.py, cal_precision.py, cal_rec.py.
